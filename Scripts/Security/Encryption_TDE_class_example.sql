-- Now that we have the backup, let's restore this backup to a different instance of SQL Server.

-- Failed Restore - No Key, No Certificate

-- The first scenario for restoring a TDE protected database is the case where we try 
-- to do the restore and we have none of the encryption pieces in place. 
-- We don't have the database master key and we certainly don't have the certificate. 
-- This is why TDE is great. If you don't have these pieces, the restore simply 
-- won't work. Let's attempt the restore (note: your paths may be different):

-- Attempt the restore teachers bd without the certificate installed
RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDE]
  FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO 'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO 'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer_log.mdf';
GO
-- of course it failsssss we dont have the certificate

--Msg 33111, Level 16, State 3, Line 130
--Cannot find server certificate with thumbprint '0x192834B1A8B932393B9101D24B8F759A49BB1397'.
--Msg 3013, Level 16, State 1, Line 130
--RESTORE DATABASE is terminating abnormally.

-- This will fail. Here's what you should see if you attempt the restore:

-- When SQL Server attempts the restore, it recognizes it needs a certificate, a specific certificate at that. Since the certificate isn't present, the restore fails.



-- Failed Restore - The Same Certificate Name, But Not the Same Certificate

-- The second scenario is where the database master key is present and there's a certificate with the same name as the first server (even the same subject), but it wasn't the certificate from the first server. Let's set that up and attempt the restore:

-- Let's create the database master key and a certificate with the same name
-- But not from the files. Note the difference in passwords
CREATE MASTER KEY
  ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'SecondServerPassw0rd!';
GO 

-- Though this certificate has the same name, the restore won't work
CREATE CERTIFICATE PPD_second_cert
  WITH SUBJECT = 'TDE Cert for Test';
GO 

-- Since we don't have the corrected certificate, this will fail, too.
RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDE]
  FROM DISK = N'C:\Backups\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_teachers.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_teachers_log.mdf';
GO

-- in efect it fails with teh new certificates..... 

--Msg 33111, Level 16, State 3, Line 163
--Cannot find server certificate with thumbprint '0x192834B1A8B932393B9101D24B8F759A49BB1397'.
--Msg 3013, Level 16, State 1, Line 163
--RESTORE DATABASE is terminating abnormally.

-- Note the difference in the password for the database master key. It's different, but that's not the reason we'll fail with respect to the restore. It's the same problem as the previous case: we don't have the correct certificate. As a result, you'll get the same error as in the previous case.



----------

-- The Successful Restore

-- In order to perform a successful restore, we'll need the database master key in the master database in place and we'll need to restore the certificate used to encrypt the database, but we'll need to make sure we restore it with the private key. In checklist form:

--There's a database master key in the master database.
--The certificate used to encrypt the database is restored along with its private key.
--The database is restored.
--Since we have the database master key, let's do the final two steps. Of course, since we have to clean up the previous certificate, we'll have a drop certificate in the commands we issue:

-- Let's do this one more time. This time, with everything,
-- Including the private key.
DROP CERTIFICATE PPD_teachers_cert;
GO 

-- Restoring the certificate, but without the private key.
CREATE CERTIFICATE PPD_teachers_cert
  FROM FILE = 'C:\data\teacher_files\TDECert.cer'
  WITH PRIVATE KEY ( 
    FILE = N'C:\data\teacher_files\TDECert_key.pvk',
 DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Abcd1234.'
  );
GO

-- We have the correct certificate and we've also restored the 
-- private key. Now everything should work. Finally!
RESTORE DATABASE [RecoveryWithTDE]
  FROM DISK = N'C:\data\teacher_files\RecoveryWithTDE_Full.bak'
  WITH MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer.mdf',
       MOVE 'RecoveryWithTDE_log' TO N'C:\data\RecoveryWithTDE_2ndServer_log.mdf';
GO

-- With everything in place, we are finally successful!
