-- Create a �Last Modified� Column in SQL Server
/*
DML trigger statements use two special tables: the deleted table and the inserted tables.

SQL Server automatically creates and manages these tables. You can use these temporary,
memory-resident tables to test the effects of certain data modifications and
to set conditions for DML trigger actions. You cannot directly modify the data in the tables or
perform data definition language (DDL) operations on the tables, such as CREATE INDEX.

In DML triggers, the inserted and deleted tables are primarily used to perform the following:

Extend referential integrity between tables.

Insert or update data in base tables underlying a view.

Test for errors and take action based on the error.

Find the difference between the state of a table before and after a data modification and
take actions based on that difference.
